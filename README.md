# Yield and Blocks

## Objectives

1. Understand how the `yield` keyword works in Ruby.
2. Practice using `yield` with blocks.
3. Gain a deeper understanding of the common iterator `#each`.

## Calling a Method with a Block

A block is a bit of code enclosed in `do`/`end` keywords, or enclosed in curly brackets, `{}`. We've seen methods like `#each` and `#collect` being called with blocks.

Let's take a look at the following example:

```ruby
["Tim", "Tom", "Jim"].each do |name|
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
```

Here we are calling `#each` on our array of names. The `#each` method is being called with a block, the code between the `do`/`end` keywords. Each element contained in our array is getting passed, or yielded, to the block on each successive step of the iteration.

Let's take a look at another example. In the below snippet, we're writing a method that `puts` out every word in the array that starts with the letter `"T"`:

```ruby
["Tim", "Tom", "Jim"].each do |name|
  if name.start_with?("T")
	  puts "Hi, #{name}"
  end
end
```

Once again, our `#each` method is yielding each element of the array to the accompanying block. The code in the block is executed, using each successive element from the array, as the iteration proceeds.

But how do `#each`, and the other iterators like `#collect`, actually pass, or yield, each successive element to its accompanying block? Under the hood, these methods rely on the `yield` keyword.

Let's take a closer look at `yield` and try to build our own custom methods that utilize it.

## The `yield` Keyword

The `yield` keyword, when used inside the body of a method, will allow you to call that method with a block and pass, or "yield", to that block. Think of the `yield` keyword as saying "stop executing the code in this method and instead execute the code in the block. Then, return to the code in the method."

Let's look at the following example:

```ruby
def yielding
  puts "the program is executing the code inside the method"
  yield
  puts "now we are back in the method"
end
```

To call this method with a block, we use the following syntax:

```ruby
yielding {puts "the method has yielded to the block!"}
```

or:

```ruby
yielding do
  puts "the method has yielded to the block!"
end
```

When we call `yielding` with the above block, we will output:

```ruby
"the program is executing the code inside the method"
"the method has yielded to the block!"
"now we are back in the method"
```


#### Yielding With Parameters

The `yield` keyword can take parameters. In other words, if you use yield and give it an argument, it will pass that argument to the block and that data will become available to the code in the block.

For example:

```ruby
def yielding_with_arguments(num)
  puts "the program is executing the code inside the method"
  yield(num)
  puts "now we are back in the method"
end
```

To call this method, we invoke our method and give it an argument *and* we accompany that method call with a block that contains a placeholder for the yielded value, plus whatever code we want to enact with that yielded value:

```ruby
yielding_with_arguments(2) {|i| puts i * 2}
```

We call our method with an argument:

```ruby
yielding_with_arguments(2)
```
and a block:

```ruby
{ |i| puts i * 2 }
```

The `|i|` (placeholder variable in between pipes) is our placeholder for the yielded value. The `i * 2` is the code we actually want to enact with our yielded value.

So, the above method call will output:

```ruby
"the program is executing the code inside the method"
4
"now we are back in the method"
```

The syntax inside the block might look familiarâ€”it is how we identify index items in a block when we call `#each` on an array and pass a block to that method call.

## Code Along: Building Our Own Method with Yield

Let's revisit our earlier example of a call to the `#each` method that only `puts` out a greeting if the word we pass into the block starts with the letter `"T"`.

```ruby
["Tim", "Tom", "Jim"].each do |name|
	if name.start_with?("T")
		puts "Hi, #{name}"
	end
end
```

In this example, we'll be building our own method, `#hello_t`.

Open up `lib/hello.rb`. We'll be coding the body of the `#hello_t` method.

#### Step 1: Defining our method to accept an argument

Our method needs to operate on an array so let's define it to take in an argument:

```ruby
# lib/hello.rb

def hello_t(array)
	# code here
end
```

Great, let's move on.

#### Step 2: Enacting an iteration

We know that we want to yield each element of the array successively to a block that we will call this method with. Let's use a `while` loop to create our iteration:

```ruby
def hello_t(array)
  i = 0
  while i < array.length
    i = i + 1
  end
end
```

##### `while` Loop Review

In the code above, we set a counter variable, `i`, equal to `0`. We start our `while` loop and tell it to execute the code in between the `while` and `end` keywords as long as `i` is less than the length of the array. Inside our `while` loop, we increment the value of our `i` variable.

Now, we need to tell our method to actually `yield` each member of the array, as we loop over it, to the block we will call our `#hello_t` method with.

#### Step 3: Yielding to the Block

The first time through our `while` loop, `i` is set equal to zero. The second time through the loop, `i` is set equal to `1`, and so on. This will go until until `i` is equal to the last index number of our array.

So, inside each step of the `while` loop, `i` equals a given index number of our array. We can use this information to yield each successive value stored in our array, to our block.

```ruby
def hello_t(array)
  i = 0
  while i < array.length
    yield array[i]
		i = i + 1
  end
end
```

Here, we use the `[]`, bracket, method to grab the value of each successive index element as we proceed through our `while` loop, and `yield` it to a block. Now we're ready to call our method:

#### Step 4: Calling Our Method

Let's call our method with an argument of the following array:

```ruby
["Tim", "Tom", "Jim"]
```

```ruby
hello_t(["Tim", "Tom", "Jim"]) do |name|
	if name.start_with?("T")
		puts "Hi, #{name}"
	end
end
```

Copy and paste the above method call into your `lib/hello.rb` file and run the file with `ruby lib/hello.rb` in your terminal. You should see the following:

```bash
Hi, Tim
Hi, Tom
```

We call our method with the argument of our array and accompany that method call with a block that contains the `name` parameter and the desired code to `puts` out a greeting if the person's name begins with the letter `"T"`. Good job!

#### Step 5: Passing Our Test

Go ahead and run the test suite by typing `learn` into your terminal in the directory of this lesson. You'll see that our test is expecting us to return the original array but our method is currently returning nil.

How can we fix this? We can tell our `#hello_t` method to return the original array:

```ruby
def hello_t(array)
  i = 0
  while i < array.length
    yield(array[i])
    i = i + 1
  end
  array
end
```

Here, we tell our method to return the original array simply by having that array be the last line of the method. Whatever is evaluated last in a method will be it's return value. If you run the test again, you should be passing.


### Advanced: Defining a method to optionally take a block

In the examples above, our methods will break if they are called without an accompanying block. We like our code to be flexible and accommodating. In other words, we don't want our code to break so easily.

Let's refactor our `#hello` method so that it can be called either with or without a block:

```ruby
def hello_t(array)
  if block_given?
    i = 0
    while i < array.length
      yield(array[i])
      i = i + 1
    end
    array
  else
    puts "Hey! No block was given!"
  end
end
```

**The `block_given?` method** returns true if the method that contains `block_given?` is called with a block and false if it is not.

So, our `#hello_t` method will `yield` each element of the array to the block if a block is present, otherwise it will `puts` out a helpful phrase.

## Enumerators Under the Hood

You've already worked with enumerator methods like `#each`, `#collect` and others. These methods are called on collections, like arrays. They take blocks as their arguments and *yield* each element of the collection to the block, allowing the code in the block to be applied to each element of the collection.

In the code-along above, we built our own implementation of the `#each` method. We used `while` to loop, or iterate, over each element of the array and passed, or yielded, each of those elements to an accompanying block. That block used parameters, `|i|`, to set a variable, `i`, equal to whatever value is yielded into the block at each successive step of the iteration. That block also contained code to execute with each yield element in turn.
